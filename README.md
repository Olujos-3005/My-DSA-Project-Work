# My-DSA-Project-Work

This is where I started my portfolio building while taking Data Analysis class with the Incubator Hub.

I have learnt quite a number of things, ranging from Ms. Excel to SQL and Power BI and now to my Portfolio Building.

## Project Topic: DSA Data Analysis Capstone Project

## Case Study : Amazon Product Review Analysis 

### Project Overview:

This Data Analysis project aims to generate insights that can guide product improvement, marketing strategies and customer engagement for a company that provides e-commerce analytic solutions to sellers on platform.

  - For Data Cleaning
    1. Data Manipulation
    2. Data Munching
    3. Column Splitting

- SQL Server (For Querying and Analysis)

- Power BI (For creating a report)  

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

At the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparations, we performed the following actions;
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing variables
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Data Analysis

I used Pivot Tables and Calculated Columns to analyse Data and to answer questions such as:
 1. What is the average discount percentage by product category?
 2. How many products are listed under each category?
 3. What is the total number of reviews per category?
 4. Which products have the highest average rating?
 5. Which products have the highest number of reviews?
 6. Which categorie have products with the the highest discounts?
 7. Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined, 
 And so on.

### Dashboard Creation

This is the final task of this project where we showcased our creativity to build Dashboard with the use of cleaned Dataset and Pivot outputs.
