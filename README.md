# My-DSA-Project-Work

This is where I started my portfolio building while taking Data Analysis class with the Incubator Hub.

I have learnt quite a number of things, ranging from Ms. Excel to SQL and Power BI and now to my Portfolio Building.

## Project Topic: DSA Data Analysis Capstone Project

## Case Study : Amazon Product Review Analysis 

### Project Overview:

This Data Analysis project aims to generate insights that can guide product improvement, marketing strategies and customer engagement for a company that provides e-commerce analytic solutions to sellers on platform by analysing product and customer review data.

### Data Source: 

The primary source of Data used here is the dataset that contains information scraped from Amazon Product pages such as Product details, Customers engagement with each row represents a unique product and aggregated reviewer data stored as comma-separated values.

### Tools Used:

- Microsoft Excel for Data Cleaning[Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
  
  - For Data Collection
  - For Data Cleaning
    1. Data Manipulation
    2. Data Munching
    3. Column Splitting

- SQL Server (For Querying and Analysis)

- Power BI (For creating a report)  

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

At the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparations, we performed the following actions;
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing variables
3. Data cleaning and formatting
4. Dataset completion for pivot tables and dashboards

### Data Analysis

I used Pivot Tables and Calculated Columns to analyse Data and to answer questions such as:
 1. What is the average discount percentage by product category?
 2. How many products are listed under each category?
 3. What is the total number of reviews per category?
 4. Which products have the highest average rating?
 5. Which products have the highest number of reviews?
 6. Which categorie have products with the the highest discounts?
 7. What is the total potential revenue by category, one of the calculated columns
 8. Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined, 
 And so on.

### Dashboard Creation

This is the final task of this project, where we showcased our creativity to build Dashboards with the use of cleaned Dataset and Pivot outputs. 
This aspect revealed the relationship between the products, price and category. 

N.B: Whatever you have here depicts an introductory stage of a Data Analyst, continuous training for intermediate and advance stages is required.
Thank you.
