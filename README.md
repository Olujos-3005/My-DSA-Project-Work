# My-DSA-Project-Work

This is where I started my portfolio building while taking Data Analysis class with the Incubator Hub.

I have learnt quite a number of things, ranging from Ms. Excel to SQL and Power BI and now to my Portfolio Building.

## Project Topic: DSA Data Analysis Capstone Project

## Case Study : Amazon Product Review Analysis 

### Project Overview: As a Data Analyst under the tutelage of DSA / Incubator Hub, I worked with a team as we were tasked with analysing product and customers review data to generate insights that could guide product improvement, marketing strategies and customer engagement for a company that provides e-commerce analytic solutions to sellers on platform.
